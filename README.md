# Event Log Analysis using pm4py
### Description
This project analyzes event log data from the ACME Teaching Case using the pm4py package to discover existing issues in the process. The analysis includes data preprocessing, conversion to event logs, and generating several charts to visualize the process flow and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
Visualizing the Data:

Several charts are generated to visualize the process flow, including:
- **Process Map:** Visual representation of the entire process flow.
